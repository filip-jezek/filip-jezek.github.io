## Process
Everyone is welcome to contribute a post to the Modelica newsletter, however the editor holds the right to decline without reason. The submission is done by creating a pull request to the dedicated newsletter repository.
{% if site.contribution-open %}

The submissions are currently open! The deadline for contributions to the current issue is {{ site.contribution-deadline }}. The newsletter would be published on {{ site.current-newsletter-date }}.

0. Create a GitHub account, log in.
1. Navigate to the [newsletter repository]({{site.current-contribution-url}}).
2. Click Create new markdown file, e.g. *my-new-post.md* (the file extension is important)
3. Insert your post. You can reuse the example below or inspire yourself from other posts in the folder. 
4. Commit changes. 
   * Note, that no changes has been made to the [newsletter repository]({{site.current-contribution-url}}). Instead, GitHub created your own copy (*a fork*) of the repository with your changes. 
   * If you already have this repository forked, you may create a new branch from the original repository.
   * If you want to modify your contribution or add a local image, you have to navigate to this branch of your fork (e.g. patch-1) and click on Create Pull-request.
5. Create pull-request   
6. Submit the pull request.
  {% else %}

*The contributions are closed right now*

{% endif %}

## Structure
Each post should start with a header information, starting and ending with a line with three slashes '---'. Then, three meta-information shall be inserted:
- `title` - a short title. Can be nested into quotes to prevent special characters (e.g. colons) from breaking the text.
- `author` - authors of the contribution and their affiliations, preferably including hyperlinks `[Modelica Association](http://modelica.org)`
- `category` - a category of the post. Currently, these four categories are currently accepted:
  - `"association"` - news regarding Modelica association
  - `"education"` - news regarding educational resources, or training  
  - `"library"` - news regarding new or improved libraries
  - `"vendor"` - news regarding new Modelica tools versions
  
## Markdown syntax   
For the text body, use the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) flavor of the Markdown syntax. See the [quick reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

### Text style
You can use **emphasize** by double asterisks (`**emphasize**`) or *italics* using single asterisks (`*italics*`).

It is easy to create [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) (as `[hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)`)

### Images
Each post is welcome to have at least one image. If you commit the image together with your post, you can link it relatively, i. e.

    ![](logo.jpg)

or if the image resides online, you can also provide an absolute address, e.g.

    ![](https://modelica.org/logo.jpg)
    
### Preview
If writing directly in GitHub, make use of the *Preview changes* - which offers a live formatted preview of your text, including the images.

## Example
You can use the following code as a basis for your article:
