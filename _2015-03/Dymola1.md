The 7th International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Modeling Languages and Tools will take place in Milano, Italy within Spring 2016. Details, important dates and CfP will be published soon on the EOOLT website . For further information, simply ask
- Francesco Casella, General Chair, francesco.casellapolimi.it

## SCOPE:
The EOOLT workshop is the opportunity to present and discuss the ongoing development of equation-based, object-oriented languages and their corresponding tools. This refers to languages like Modelica but also includes other technologies such as SysML, VHDL-AMS, Simulink/ Simscape, COMSOL, etc.

Contributions focus on methodological aspects and describe new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition to full contributions also shorter work-in-progress paper are welcome and offer an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.

Typical themes of the EOOLT workshop reach from language design over modeling aspects to simulation code:
- Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics
- Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages
- Verification, type systems, and early static checking
- Discrete-event and hybrid modeling
- Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages.
- Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
- Equation-based in the frame of system engineering
- Reflection and meta-programming.
- Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging.
- Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics
- Generation of simulation code for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, distributed systems, etc.
- Tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models.
